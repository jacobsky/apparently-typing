# apparently-typing microblog site

Part 3 of my go learning projects. I'm building my small microblog platform. This will eventually spin out into being my formal longterm blog.

## Tasks
- [x] Project configuration and layout
- [x] Markdown static blog parsing
- [x] Blog index
- [ ] Implement [Basecoatui](https://basecoatui.com/) or [templui](https://templui.io) for styling and components in the various pages and fill out the full blog.
- [ ] HTMX and Alpine integration for smoother actions.

Not a very interesting title, I will admit, but for the moment it will have
to do. I don't have any specific plans for this blog other than to be where
I post things that I think about related to my hobbies/tech.

You can probably consider this a personal diary that I am just putting out
there to generally talk about tech interests, job stuff and life stuff.

In actuality, this post is mostly just here to help fill out the test data
for building this micro blog site to learn go. In particular, I'm using the
following to build up the static pages for my embedded filesystem like the
following code sample.

```go //go:embed blog var blogposts embed.FS ```

Anyways, hopefully, I have better musings in the future. For now I'll keep
working on getting this working as I learn all about the ins and outs of go +
templ + tailwind.

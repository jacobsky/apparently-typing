# Dev Log 1 - Building the pit of success
Since I am in need of some additional testing, I am creating this blog entry.

While this blog is partially used as a learning task, one of the big things that I am trying to do is fine tune my ability to properly write blog posts.

Writing blog posts has always been a bit tedious for me in the past mostly because 1) I failed to make publishing hands off and 2) places that make publishing hands off are always offering their own text editors which are not always ideal for writing and editing your ideas.

What usually happens with anything is that the more barriers or tricks you have to do in order to make things work the less likely you will be to do it. This doesn't just apply to blogging though. Most of the best technologies emphasize making the "easy way" to do things, the "best way" to do things.

Particularly good examples of a pit of success include:
- Errors as values
- Tagged unions
- Strongly Static typing

While not everyone will agree, one of the things that each of the above does successfully is make the easiest way to do something, _the best way to solve something_ in the given language. This also occurs with good operational management with actions like automation for _everything_; strong opinionated formatting in place of a style guide; and using plain text documentation that is easily parsed and accessible for everything.

With much of that inspiration in mind, I set about creating this blog as a way to better build _my perfect pit of success_ for a blog that is easy to write, update and generally work with.

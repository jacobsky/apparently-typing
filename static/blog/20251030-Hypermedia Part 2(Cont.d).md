### A continued diatribe on hypermedia technologies.

Over the last week, I have had a very pleasant time working with datastar. Originally, I had intended to stick primarily to HTMX and Alpine for the frontend reactivity, but Datastar has largely won me over (for personal projects at least) due to it's heavy emphasis on easily including both aspects of reactivity into my applications. In fact, I got another idea that is probably only possible with datastar (or a SPA, but let's be real, SPAs are just not what I'm interested in).

What I've really kind of nailed down over the last week is that I feel that the discussion with the web is _usually_ all about trade-offs in performance, simplicity, richeness, etc. But the strangest thing about datastar is that it feels like... I get everything and I get it all for free? Which makes me kind of question the modern web, like really?

In reality this is kind of the perfect approach where the tool itself exposes very simple tooling that can be used to make very expressive web applications.

**NOTE**: Datastar is still 100% hypermedia focused. Interactions are not driven by the client, but rather driven by and streamed from the server. Datastar is not going to replace some of the frontend frameworks that can turn the web into a thick client delivery system (though, I feel like a native app is a better fit than a web browser in this case, but there's probably some economic or install base incentive at work I am unaware of). _Anyways_ onto some of the fun that is the GoTD (Go + Templ + Datastar) stack.

In addition to the normal `sse.PatchElement()` the go SDK directly ships with a convenience method for templ `sse.PatchTempl()` which makes writing SSEs via HTML fragments entirely unnecesary. You can just pass in the component you are wanting to patch directly into the event like so:

```go

func myhandler (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    sse := datastar.NewSSE(w, r)
    _ = sse.PatchTempl(MyComponent())
}
```

The convenience functionality for working with signals also makes a lot of the server-driven reactivity absolutely trivial such as this quick and dirty example of reading the signals and patching them. Note: There's a bit of an unspoken order of operations that you must read the signals _before_ opening an Server Sent Event, so some of the error handling can be a smidge clunky around this specific aspect. 

**NOTE** Datastar is __not__ expecting that all the signals be defined in `MySignals` while it will send all signals (unless filtered) the SDK is smart enough to ensure that only the specific keys listed will be taken. In this example, if there were actually `third` and `fourth` defined as signals in the Templates, there will be no errors in running the following.
```go
type MySignals struct {
    First string `json:"first"`
    Second bool `json:"second"`
}

func myhandler (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    signals := &MySignals{}
	_ := datastar.ReadSignals(r, signals)
    sse := datastar.NewSSE(w, r)
    // Just some operations 
    signals.First = "New Value"
    signals.Second = !signals.Second
	output, _ := json.Marshal(signals)
    _ := sse.PatchSignals(output)
}
```

With these two building blocks it makes it trivial to drive any and all behavior with the server. For example, in my first actual project (an LLM wrapper app, plz don't judge) the entire transaction is served via signals to indicate the current step of the process, from loading to actually assembling the final output and updating the DOM with the final result of the transaction (all in one single post request).

What impresses me is that I started this knowing basically _nothing_ and stumbled into a reasonable streaming based approach to incrementally send updates to the frontend from the server. With minimal additional code. It also -- in many ways -- feels simpler than working with HTMX and the HTML fragments (templ is lovely and does this fantastically with HTMX, but somehow the "simpler" solution of HTMX feels a bit more clunky since each endpoint _must_ return HTML and you need something else to support event streams like websockets)

That being said, while I have had nothing but good experiences with datastar, it's not without it's hangups. In particular, I ran into three minor issues as I worked on my initial prototype:

1. SDKs documentation can be a little variable (the go SDK documentation seemed a bit sparse of examples). This was mostly rectified by me just using my LSP to dig, but I could see it being a bit of a hangup with adoption into organizations.
2. There seems to be a minor disagreement with how two of the 1.0 RCs work that have some cryptic (or non-existent) syntax errors (particularly `data-attr-myattr` vs `data-attr:myattr`). It was nothing major, but lead to some initial hangups and confusion.
3. The debugger being blocked behind pro might hinder adoption slightly. I don't think it's entirely necessary, but -- at the very least -- the build in developer tools did not seem to be as consistent with catching the signals.

This doesn't really detract majorly from my enjoyment of using it. It's an incredible tool that really makes building webapps a joy while making much of the complex reactivity relatively trivial to implement. It also makes me excited to see what else I can build with it.

For now, it's probably going to be the tool that I lean on (alongside go and templ) when building internal tooling. I think it's still a bit too early to go _all in_ on it for critical workloads whereas something a little more mature like HTMX might be a better fit, _for now_.

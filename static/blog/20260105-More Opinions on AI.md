In my last post, I wrote about my complex feelings regarding `opencode`
and the general AI workflows in how I integrate it into my workflows.
To save you some time, my general conclusion is that it's currently
"not great, not terrible" and can be used for automating certain tedious
tasks as well as being _great_ for code reviews. I generally find it to
be generally useless for building, well, anything that I'm interested
in building.

Over the past few weeks I have had a few really interesting use cases that
lead me to feel that much of the _focus_ on AI is backwards.

The focus of the AI tech and thought leaders in the industry is fixated on:

- Replace Software Engineers
- Replace Writers
- Replace Artists
- Replace Data Scientists
- Replace Doctors

But this idea of "How to replace X, Y, Z" is an _absolutely terrible_ mentality.
AI's most valuable contribution is not in replacing humanity (it does this poorly).

AI's greatest contribution is in being a way that we can augment outselves.

## Learning Assistant

As I mentioned before, I fell into a trap over the last few years of replacing
my Japanese Language studies with AI tooling instead of self study and reliance.
In part, this was due to the nature of my work putting a heavy focus on immediate
efficiency rather than long term benefits. It is also because of how tempting it is.

Humans are always tempted with the path of least resistance, especially an (at the time)
untreated ADHD brain where running headlong into a roadblock requires inexorable will
to defeat. Leaning on the machine _is always_ a temptation.

_However_, I find myself coming back to lean on AI in my second attempt at learning.
The big difference is that I've fundamentally shifted my mentality when approaching
who to integrate AI into my learnings. Instead of approaching things from a "AI
do Japanese for me" way, I've shifted it into being a strict, albeit helpful, teaching
assistant. As always, it is no replacement for proper study materials, or instructors
_but_ they aren't always available at all times and AI can easily fill in that gap.
(such was the motivation behind making my [Joshu](joushu.apparently-typ.ing) tool
which helps me to get corrections to my writing)

This also goes further with other study. _While a major copyright concern_, it
is a fact of the modern age that the best way to learn is learning in the
modern age is by just trying something and searching the internet for solutions.
As always, the difference in approach fundamentally comes down to whether you are
just copy pasting the answer, _or_ trying to learn _why_ the answer fixes it.

This use-case has just been _absolutely mindblowingly_ good at helping me noticeably
level up my language skills, but it requires the discipline to _never_ copy paste the
output. Read it, distill it, and _write it yourself_. That's the only way that it
contributes to yourself.

## Brain Storming Assistant

My second place is how I tend to get lost in my own ideas and have difficulty starting.
I recently did an experiment with de-rusting in Java (it's just really popular where I live)
and one of the things that I was trying to figure out what just "Where do I start?".

Asking AI "I wanna study java by making a webserver, where should I start" gave me a great
starting point where various search results just lead me to more questions.

It doesn't replace me actually doing the work (though again, it's a good learning tool
when you don't copy-paste) but it does help me to get _unstuck_ and break
out of a writer's block.

This might just be me, but sometimes I need something that can just kind of give me
a direction that I'm incapable of deciding on myself. This part is the
fundamentally important use of AI in my workflow.

It can be the first place I stop _prior_ to talking to a mentor or subject matter
expert in unsticking myself.

_AGAIN_ ingesting the information and considering it myself is the critical part.
Copying and pasting _is no good_ if you care about your own knowledge and skills
in the "age of AI".

## Philosophy AI Augmented Development

One of the things that I feel like I need to preface a lot of this with is that,
fundamentally, my personal development and understanding is _on me_. I need to be
at the core of any tools. It doesn't matter if it is Neovim, my cell phone,
obsidian (my note taking app), git, or whatever. The tools are methods of augmenting
myself and AI is no different.

While some might be fine with allowing the AI to write the code for them, the
liability is always on me and my understanding of language/code.
This mostly leads me into the scenario of using AI tooling to augment my various
workflows (learning, studying, developing, reviewing). The big difference is that
I am at the center of the AI workflows, and I cannot reasonably provide it to I need to

## Usual Concerns

It still stinks that AI is kinda just, really bad for the planet in a era where
sustainability should be a much more important topic. It's a shame that the great
AI datacenter race is taking priority over attempting to determine how to better
build sustainable infrastructure.

I still find that model vendor locking is a big source of anxiety with relying on
these tools. Most of the personal AI frameworks that people build out _heavily_
rely on various proprietary models such as Anthropic's Opus and given how early
we find ourselves in the AI adoption and lifecycle, it's hard for me to embrace
building more of my life around an AI infrastructure when we aren't past the AI
bubble yet.

While I am absolutely sure that AI will play a role in the world after the bubble,
there will be winners and losers of the bubble. We have no idea whether Anthropic,
Google, Meta, or some other company will come out on top. So using proprietary
models will always feel a bit uncomfortable. Though, lacking a spare $100k USD
to build my own solution, the only option is to use online models.

Perhaps the best place to start is aiming for the opensource models that I have
the possibility of running at home. I cannot afford to build a scaffolding for
my life that vanishes with a company declaring bankruptcy
